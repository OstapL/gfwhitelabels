      h3.m0 PayBack Share is a revenue share agreement that may be a good choice for:
      ul.simple-list.list-style-alphabet.mb45.text-justify
        li.mt15 Companies that generate or expect to generate cash (your operating earnings will have to be &gt; 5% of your revenue for this to make sense);
        li.mt15 LLC&rsquo;s that are looking for ways to raise funds without the need to issue K-1s; and
        li.mt15 Companies that want to maintain a clean capital structure in anticipation of a future venture capital fundraising round.

      h3.m0 Here&apos;s how it works:
      ol.simple-list.mb45.text-justify
        li.mt15 You share at least 5% of your revenue annually;
        li.mt15 No distribution is required until the second full calendar year and you are allowed one year of forbearance as needed;
        li.mt15 Distributions are capped at 2x the invested amount, at which point your obligation is fulfilled.

      h3.m0 Here are some of the advantages of choosing Revenue Share:
      ol.simple-list.mb45.text-justify
        li.mt15 It does not dilute the ownership of current shareholders or the control of management;
        li.mt15 It avoids a prolonged negotiation over valuation and a &ldquo;messy cap table&rdquo;;
        li.mt15 It may be easier to raise capital and attract investors by offering the potential to earn regular cash distributions;
        li.mt15 It gives you the chance to keep more of the upside since once investors&rsquo; have received 2x their money back, you will have no further obligation.
