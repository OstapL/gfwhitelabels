I have a few questions and will likely invest: 1. With a growing company with great potential like yours I worry a little about \"net\" revenue shares.  How will you decide what revenue to roll back into continued growth and what to let fall into net and pay to investors?  I don't see any time limit on payback time.  2. Is anyone else that you know of doing what you are doing?  3. Have you had any push-back on the 10-25% commission from contractors?  4. What will likely be the first place you expand - how will you decide?  Sorry for the many questions - thanks very much in advance.", "related": "", "user_id": 513, "children": [{"uid": "3bd901f0-d370-44ea-a2e7-a99b20c8c6e5", "message": "Hi Alan, thank you for your questions and kind words!\n\n1. Investors get paid out of total or top line revenue until you are paid back twice your investment. There is not a limit on payback time. However our growth is expected to be quick and substantial, though not guaranteed to be.\n2. After scanning the market for some time, we are not aware of anyone else doing what we are doing.\n3. There has not been pushback from contractors on our commissions. The reason for that is simple, it is common for contractors to be hired by other contractors at a 20% or so markup. So common in fact, we can't think of a single contractor in our system who has even questioned it.\n4. We are expanding to Tulsa, OK next. It is a market similar to Kansas City and should work well to expand and complete testing of our version one platform. After substantial data is collected from KC and Tulsa we will use it to determine which major market in which to expand further.\n\nWe hope these answers are helpful. You can also find additional details in our investor presentation.\n\nThank you again so much Alan for your consideration!\n\nKalen Barker", "related": "", "user_id": 632, "children": [{"uid": "28469c9a-3fc1-49df-938c-7a377a5d5124", "message": "Hi Kalen, the fact that the payback would come from total instead of net revenue it great, but can you confirm because your Form C says it is coming from net (page 14).  Also - and I apologize because this is probably obvious - but your 500K of revenue mentioned above is just your 20% (or so) commissions, so you actually booked something closer to 2.5 million worth of jobs?  Thanks for your quick response! ", "related": "", "user_id": 513, "children": [{"uid": "30011ea0-d2b7-4da2-8379-8354539cda35", "message": "Hi Alan, thanks for the additional questions. It's my pleasure to clear this up for you.\n\nThe revenue share defines Net Revenue as net of discounts and returns.  In BlueHollar\u2019s case, for example, 2016 held revenue at $275,469.60 less $886 of refunds, resulting in $274,583.60 in net revenue.  If the Revenue Share had been outstanding in 2016, BlueHollar would have shared 5%*$274,583.60 with investors, or $13,729.18.\n \nThe idea is that there is no room for manipulation; the Revenue Pool is calculated formulaically and then paid to investors annually.\n\nAlso, the 500k is our total job sales which we have profited a percentage of. Our estimated total sales in the first fifteen months post investment are between 4-6 million dollars based on our current proven metrics.\n\nI hope that helps. I'm happy to answer as many questions as you may have.\n\nKalen Barker", "related": "", "user_id": 632, "children": [], "created_date": "2017-03-29T17:52:19.620504", "user": {"id": 632, "first_name": "Kalen", "last_name": "Barker", "role": 5, "image_data": {"id": 5129, "mime": "image/jpeg", "name": "User12.jpg", "urls": {"main": "/ce1793153428e6821e6a63969d763cd30e408f21.jpg", "50x50": "/93cf3d89206bb5c5a74b6d09c1d66d8598ab033e.jpg", "origin": "/c46a62f441bcfb0b969d0ff5507bd4b78331be10.jpg"}, "site_id": 23}}}], "created_date": "2017-03-29T16:15:12.198434", "user": {"id": 513, "first_name": "Alan", "last_name": "Jacobson", "role": null, "image_data": []}}], "created_date": "2017-03-29T15:44:22.376444", "user": {"id": 632, "first_name": "Kalen", "last_name": "Barker", "role": 5, "image_data": {"id": 5129, "mime": "image/jpeg", "name": "User12.jpg", "urls": {"main": "/ce1793153428e6821e6a63969d763cd30e408f21.jpg", "50x50": "/93cf3d89206bb5c5a74b6d09c1d66d8598ab033e.jpg", "origin": "/c46a62f441bcfb0b969d0ff5507bd4b78331be10.jpg"}, "site_id": 23}}}], "created_date": "2017-03-29T10:46:23.955077", "user": {"id": 513, "first_name": "Alan", "last_name": "Jacobson", "role": null, "image_data": []}}, {"uid": "91f41657-e475-46f5-9e0c-1b1b2853307d", "message": "You guys need to have swift programmers and build apple store and google play.I did not see an app for you.
