With an incredibly wide field of view, high resolution display, and ultra-low latency head tracking, the Rift provides a truly immersive experience that allows you to step inside your favorite game and explore new worlds like never before.\r\n\r\nWe're here raising money on Kickstarter to build development kits of the Rift, so we can get them into the hands of developers faster. Kickstarter has proven to be an amazing platform for accelerating big and small ideas alike. We hope you share our excitement about virtual reality, the Rift, and the future of gaming.  \r\n\r\nDesigned for gamers, by gamers.\r\n\r\nThe Rift takes 3D gaming to the next level. There are a number of VR headsets out there, but none that deliver a truly immersive gaming experience. Most products either lack the technical features required for believable immersion or sit at a very high price-point ($20,000+) reserved for the military or scientific community. \r\n\r\nWe set out to change all that with the Rift, which is designed to maximize immersion, comfort, and pure, uninhibited fun, at a price everyone can afford. \r\n\r\nWe’re working with the best teams in the industry.\r\n\r\n\"What I've got now, is, I honestly think the best VR demo probably the world has ever seen.\"\r\nJohn Carmack, id Software\r\n\r\n\"Needless to say, I'm a believer... We're extremely excited here at Epic Games to get the Unreal Engine integrated with Oculus.\"\r\nCliff Bleszinski, Design Director Epic Games\r\n\r\n\"I think this will be the coolest way to experience games in the future. Simply that... that big.\"\r\nDavid Helgason, CEO Unity\r\n\r\n\"I’m really looking forward to getting a chance to program with it and see what we can do.”\r\nMichael Abrash, Valve\r\n\r\n\"It looks incredibly exciting, if anybody’s going to tackle this set of hard problems, we think that Palmer’s going to do it. So we’d strongly encourage you to support this Kickstarter.”\r\nGabe Newell, President and Owner Valve\r\n\r\nBundling DOOM 3 BFG with the Rift\r\n\r\nWe're including a copy of DOOM 3 BFG Edition, the first Oculus-ready game, with every Rift dev kit on Kickstarter. John Carmack showed DOOM 3 BFG at E3, stunning the press and creating incredible anticipation for the release.",

Westport, the town closest to the winery, is a beautiful small town adjacent to the Westport River that empties into the Atlantic. During the scenic approach, there are several river embankments and tall tree canopies, until you reach a clearing where it is suddenly vineyards as far as the eye can see!",

It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.\r\n\r\nBack then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer) had first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.",
