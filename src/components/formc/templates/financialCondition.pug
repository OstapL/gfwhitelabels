          strong For All Offerings:
          |  If your offering is conducted in the first 120 days of a fiscal year, the financial statements provided may be for the two fiscal years prior to your most recently completed fiscal year; however, the most recently completed fiscal year must be provided if available,
        p.pb10

          |  the information you provide about your tax return (total income, taxable income and total tax) may be from the tax return filed for the prior year (if any), if your offering is conducted before filing a tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year.  However, you must provide information from the tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year when it is filed, if filed during the offering period.

          strong A Word on Your Independent Accountant.
          |  The accountant that does your taxes likely does not qualify as an independent accountant. An independent accountant must satisfy the independence standards of either: (i) Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X or (ii) the AICPA. They must be (1) duly registered and in good standing as a certified public accountant (CPA) under the laws of the place of his or her residence or principal office or (2) in good standing and entitled to practice as a public accountant under the laws of his or her place of residence or principal office.
        p.pb10 Your company will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide reviewed financial statement if you received a review report that includes modifications. Likewise, you will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide audited financial statements if you received a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion.
        p You must notify the public accountant of your intended use of the public accountant’s audit or review report in the offering.
