Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.

                .border-block Our business operations may at times be dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that such business information technology might be susceptible to cyber security threats, including hacking, identity theft and acts of cyberterrorism. Additionally, our critical systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, storms, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm the systems, whether man made or acts of nature. Many of these systems will not be fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. As cyber incidents continue to evolve and as severe weather related events become more extreme, we may be required to expend additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents or natural disasters.

We will need to maintain such relationships and, in some cases, establish new ones or replace existing ones. There will be several agreements and documents that remain to be negotiated, executed, and implemented with respect to certain aspects of our planned operations. In some cases, the parties with whom we would need to establish a relationship may not yet be identified. If we are unable to enter into these agreements or relationships on satisfactory terms, our operations could be delayed or curtailed, expenses could be increased, and profitability and the likelihood of returns to investors could be adversely affected.
