          p.pb10 Please describe any transaction or proposed transaction with related parties in the last 12 months. You may want to be over-inclusive here, particularly with related party transactions that could have the appearance of a conflict of interest or a form of self-dealing. In general, if a transaction involved a potential conflict of interest that needed to be disclosed to the Board of Directors (or required shareholder approval), then it should be disclosed.
