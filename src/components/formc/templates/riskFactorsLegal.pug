The steps that the Company has taken to maintain and protect its intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. The Company’s failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect its intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property, could adversely impact the Company’s competitive position and results of operations.

                .border-block Any dispute or litigation regarding future intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all.  This could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. We may have to pay substantial damages, including damages for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our product candidates infringe a third party’s proprietary rights. Even if these claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against as could cause our business to be harmed. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation that could disrupt our operations and increase our costs of doing business. Changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as privacy and information security, product safety or environmental protection, including regulations in response to concerns regarding climate change, collective bargaining activities, minimum wage laws and health care mandates, among others, could also cause our compliance costs to increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
