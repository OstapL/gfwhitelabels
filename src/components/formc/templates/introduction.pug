        p.pb10 Congratulations on taking your first step toward fundraising in a way that brings you closer to the most important people of all: your potential customers. 
        p.pb10 As you shift from Campaign to Form C, you are now populating your legal offering document. This requires a change in tone from marketing to disclosure. In fact, this document requires 
          strong substantial and accurate financial and business disclosure 
          |  and is subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        p.pb10

          |  provide full, complete and non-misleading answers to all questions. Please note if any answer is materially inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the Company, its management and principal shareholders may be liable to investors based on that information.
        p.pb10 The purpose of the Form C is to ensure that investors receive enough disclosure to make an informed decision about your offering.

          |  answering questions with marketing-type or exaggerative language, your goal is to protect your company and investors by providing adequate disclosure.
        p You may want to have an attorney prepare this document with you since certain sections will address legal distinctions between different securities. Upon completion of your Form C, you will have an additional opportunity to review all documents with your attorney.
