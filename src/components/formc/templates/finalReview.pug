With respect to specific scenarios: (1) if the target minimum offering amount is not met prior to the target closing date, then the Intermediary will automatically cancel all investment commitments and notify each investor of the return of their respective funds, (2) if the issuer reaches the target minimum offering amount prior to the deadline identified in the offering materials, then it may close the offering early (if it provides notice about the new offering deadline at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline)

In any situation where a return of investor commitments is triggered, such funds will be returned without any accrued interest and less any fees incurred.

These Notes are unsecured so that the  repayment obligation  is  supported only by  the Company’s creditworthiness and not by any specifically  identified  collateral.    As  a  debt  security,  the  Notes  have  no  voting  rights,  which means  that  purchasers  of  the  Notes  will  have  no  ability  to  vote  on  any  matters  relating  to  the Company.

In this manner, each investor will receive their pro-rata share of the Revenue Pool in each applicable financial reporting period until such time  that each  investor  is paid back  a dollar amount equal to  two  times (2x)  the value that such investor invested in the Notes.
            li.pb10 The Company has the right to forebear one annual payment of the revenue share amount  upon  notice  to  the  investors.    Consequently,  the  Company  will  have  no repayment  obligation  in  the  first  full  twelve  (12)  month  financial  reporting  period following  the  Offering  and  it  may  also  have  no  repayment  obligation  in  one additional  twelve  (12)  month  financial  reporting  period  which  would  delay  the repayment  of  the  required  amount  to  each  investor.The  Company  may  not exercise this forbearance right more than once.

          p.pb10.text-indent The offering price of the securities in this Offering has been established by the Company and does not necessarily bear any specific relation to the assets, book value or potential earnings of the Company or any other recognized criteria of value. The Shares have not been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and have not been traded or quoted on any exchange or quotation system. There is no public market in which shareholders may sell their Shares, and there can be no assurance given that such a market will ever develop. The securities offered hereby are restricted by law and the ability to transfer and interests in the Shares is severely limited.

          p.pb10.text-indent The Company has determined the purchase price for the Notes by taking into account its anticipated future revenue.  This purchase price was not based on any independent valuation of the Company or any of its assets.  It should be noted that one of the reasons that the Company chose to offer Revenue Share Agreement is that this type of security avoids the need to determine a valuation for the Company or its assets.  As stated on the Platform, the Intermediary has not provided any investment advice relating to the Offering or the pricing of the Notes.

          p.pb10.text-indent The price of each Share was determined by the Company in good faith based on its own assessment of its current position and the benchmarking reference range determined by the use of certain business calculators provided by the Intermediary.  Such calculators use the data provided by the Company and do not reflect any advice or recommendation on the part of the Intermediary.  In working with the calculators, the Company considered its current capital structure, including current debt and cash, and assembled an income statement from the last twelve months including an estimate of net income and EBITDA.  The Company also made projections for the next twelve months along with a similar estimate of net income and EBITDA.
          p.pb10.text-indent The Company then looked at potential peers that trade in public markets and considered a variety of metrics, including but not limited to Price/Sales, Enterprise Value/EBITDA and Price/Equity.  The Company applied a 20% liquidity discount to publically traded peers and utilized an average of different valuation metrics to derive a benchmarking range for the Company’s ultimate value.
        if values.campaign.valuation_determination == '1'
          p.pb10.text-indent The price of each Share was determined by the Company in good faith based on its own assessment of its current position and by taking a variety of quantitative and qualitative considerations into account.  Quantitatively, the Company considered revenue and operating profit, both one year from now and five years from now along with an analysis of the Company’s existing capital structure and available cash.  The Company then assessed where publicly traded peer were being valued in the markets.  After considering several different valuation metrics, including Price/Sales and Enterprise Value/EBIT, the Company discounted its valuation by its cost of capital.  The, for qualitative factors, the Company considered the type of industry that it is in and applied a discount rate appropriate for such industry.  Finally, the Company applied a liquidity discount which resulted in a post-money valuation which takes into consideration the money projected to be raised in order to derive the valuation contained in this Material.

        p.text-indent An investment in the Company’s securities involves substantial risk.  Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk factors referred to in this Material. An investor should not invest any funds in the Offering unless he or she can afford to lose his or her entire investment.  In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Company and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.  The Shares have not been recommended or reviewed by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority.  There is no ready market for the sale of the Shares and it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to sell or otherwise dispose of the Shares.

        p.text-indent There is the risk that some of the information supplied by the Company may be inaccurate.  The management of the Company has provided all of the information stated in this Material without any third party verifying or investigating such information. The Company makes no express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of this information or, in the case of projections, estimates, future plans, or forward looking assumptions or statements, as to their attainability or the accuracy and completeness of the assumptions from which they are derived.  It is expected that each prospective investor will pursue their own independent investigation.  Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

          u Risks as a Minority Holder
        if values.campaign.security_type == 0 
          p.pb10.text-indent Purchasers of a minority ownership have risks relating to limited control, limited information and limited rights.  Minority owners have no control over the marketability and value of their purchased securities and they may be required to hold onto their minority ownership position for an indefinite period.  Additionally, minority owners must address the following risks:
          ul
            li.pb10 Minority owners have no right to participate in any management decisions of the Company or the day-to-day operations. There is the risk that the majority owners make decisions or take actions that a minority owner thinks is bad for the Company.   A minority owner has limited ability to influence the governance and operations of a Company.
            li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights to information beyond those filings that are required by law to be made available.  There is the risk that minority owners may be denied immediate information about the Company’s performance or corporate affairs.
            li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights, if any, to demand current distributions from an operating business. Majority owners likely have the right and power to avoid making any distributions of profits at their discretion.  There is also the risk that the management of the Company pursues a spending plan that causes the Company not to generate any profits to be distributed.
            li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights, if any, to have their interest bought out. There is the risk that a minority owner will want to sell their interest and they will have no right to force the Company to buy them out.  There will also be liquidity risk if there is no secondary market for the Company’s securities.
            li.pb10 Minority owners have limited input into fundamental corporate changes such as sale of the Company.  There is a risk that a sale could be structured in a way to avoid certain payouts to minority owners, such as a sale of assets over time with the proceeds reinvested in another business.
            li Minority owners may have interests that are different than shareholder-officers or shareholders that are part of the management team of the Company.  There is the risk that minority owners perceive a conflict of interest if, for example, the managers that are shareholders receive a significant raise.  Additionally, there is the risk that a minority owner will want to remove a manager or board member but have no independent power to do so.

            li.pb10 The Company may take certain corporate actions that could impact Note holders, particularly if such actions impact the future revenue stream that is supporting the repayment of the Notes. 
            li.pb10 To  the  extent  that  there  is  funding  that  exceeds  the minimum  amount,  investors may experience an extended payback period as additional investors will be pulling from the same fixed revenue pool.

            li.pb10 Regarding the additional issuances of securities, there is the risk that an investor has their ownership percentage diluted if, for example, the Company decides to raise additional amounts in the future.  There is also the risk that an investor is excluded from the opportunity to participate in future fund-raising so that they are unable to maintain their ownership percentage.
            li.pb10 Regarding the authorization of new securities with different rights, there is the risk that a future investor is able to obtain rights that are superior to the rights afforded to the purchasers of the security available in this offering.
            li.pb10 To the extent that there is ever an offer to repurchase the Shares by the Company, there is the risk that investors may feel pressured to sell their Shares to the Company without fully participating in or capturing the potential increase in value of such Shares.
            li.pb10 Regarding a sale of the Company or of assets of the Company, there is the risk that any such transaction fails to maximize the value of the Company’s securities.  The investor will be required to rely on the business judgement of the management team and the Board of Directors of the Company so there can be no guarantee that the investor will receive the full market value of their Shares

The  Company  shall  have  no obligation  to  make  Revenue  Share  Payments  under  this  Agreement  in  the  Company’s  first  full Fiscal Year occurring immediately after the Issuance Date, it being understood that the Company shall have a minimum of twelve (12) months after the Issuance Date in which no Revenue Share Payment is due.  Consequently, unless the Company exercises the forbearance right described in Section  5  of  this  Agreement,  the  Company  will  begin  making  Revenue  Share  Payments  to  the Investor  within  sixty  days  after  the  conclusion  of  the  Company’s  second  full  Fiscal  Year occurring immediately after the Issuance Date.
            li.pb10
              b One-Time Payment Forbearance.
              |  In any single Fiscal Year and not in any other Fiscal Year, the Company  may  in its sole discretion  forbear the annual payment  of the Revenue Share  Payment  due  for  such  Fiscal  Year  upon  notice  to  Investor,  it  being  understood  that  such forbearance shall allow the Company to refrain from making the Revenue Share Payment for such Fiscal Year that the Company would otherwise be required to pay.  After the Company exercises the  forbearance  right  contained  in  this  Agreement,  it  may  never  use  such  right  again.    For  the avoidance of doubt, the Company may use the forbearance right contained in this Agreement only once,  and  it  in  no  way  relieves  the  Company  from  the  obligation  to  repay  the  Total  Repayment Amount.
            li.pb10
              b Voluntary  Payment  Acceleration.
              |  The  Company  may  make  payments  to  the Investor  in  excess  of  the  Revenue  Share  Payment  at  any  time  and may  fully  or  partially  prepay any  amounts  at  any  time  provided  that  such  amounts  are  counted  toward  the  Total  Repayment Amount.  The parties agree that this Agreement contains no specific due date for the repayment of the  Total  Repayment  Amount.      The  Total  Repayment  Amount  will  be  considered  paid  in full when  the  Company  has  paid  to  the  Investor  those  Revenue  Share Payments  which,  when aggregated with any prepayment amounts, collectively are equal to the Total Repayment Amount.
            li.pb10
              b Payment  upon  Change  of  Control.
              |  Upon  a  Change  of  Control  (as  defined below) at any time prior to the full payment of the  Total Repayment Amount to the Investor, the Company shall pay to the Investor, prior to or simultaneously with the closing of such Change in Control, an amount equal to the Total Repayment Amount less the sum of all previous payments made by the Company to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement.  The parties agree that the term 
              b  “Change  of  Control”  
              | shall  mean  the  earlier  to  occur  of  (a)  the  Company's  sale of  all  or substantially  all  of  its  material  assets  or  (b)  a  merger,  consolidation,  reorganization  or  similar business  transaction  which  results  in  a  change  in  the  ownership  of  more  than  50%  of  the outstanding voting power of the Company.
            li.pb10
              b Place and Form of Payment.
              |  All amounts payable hereunder shall be paid to the Investor at the address on record with the Company or to the account that Investor has designated to the Company or to the account from which Investor made the investment in the Offering.  The Company  may  use a third-party  agent to  process  any such payments and  may share information relating  to  the  Investor  with  such  third  party,  including  personally  identifying  information  and account  information.    The  Company  may,  directly  or  indirectly through  a  third  party,  transfer payments via automated clearinghouse payment, wire transfer or check at its discretion.  Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall make, or cause to be made,  continuing annual Revenue Share Payments to the Investor until the Total Repayment Amount is repaid in full.

              |  Investor  acknowledges  that  a  number  of  other participants  in  the  Offering  acquired  the  same  form  of  security  as  the  Investor  with  the  same rights to a repayment from the Available Revenue Pool of twice the amount that such participant invested  in  the  Offering  (each  such  participant,  not  including  the  Investor,  a 
              b  “Holder”
              | ).    The Company  warrants  that  Investor  and  each  Holder  invested  in  the  Company’s  securities  on  the same terms and conditions with respect to repayment although their invested amounts may differ.  This Agreement and the promise to pay contained herein is issued as part of a series of securities issued  in  the  Offering  and  the  Investor  agrees  that  payments  made  from the  Available  Revenue Pool shall be made pari passu between the Investor and each Holder in proportion to each party’s dollar  amount  invested  in  the  Offering  (excluding  any  fees  paid  to  participate  in  the  Offering).  Investor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  all  payments  required  by  this  Agreement,  including optional  payments  with  respect  to  any  prepayment  amounts,  shall  be  made  pro  rata  among  the Investor and all of the Holders based on the amount of their investment in the Offering (excluding any fees paid to participate in the Offering) and the Investor shall make no claim for any amount of any Company payment greater that the Investor’s Proportionate Share of such payment.  If the Investor shall obtain any payment from the Company that was not made proportionately to other Holders,  then  the  Investor  shall  return  the  excess  amount  to  the  Company  to  be  shared  ratably with  the   other   Holders.   The  Company’s  repayment   obligation  to  the  Investor  under  this Agreement  shall  be  on  parity  with  the  Company’s  obligation  to  repay  all  of  the  Holders  of securities issued in the same Offering.  If the Company does not have sufficient funds to repay all participants in the Offering, then payment shall be  made ona pro  rata basis among the  Investor and all of the Holders based on the amount of their investment in the Offering (excluding any fees paid to participate in the Offering).
            li.pb10
              b Unsecured  Obligation.
              |  Investor  understands  and  accepts  that  the  promise  and obligation to repay the  Total Repayment Amount is an unsecured obligation and that no security interest of any form is granted by this Agreement in any asset held by the Company.  No party has guaranteed  the  repayment  of  the  Total  Repayment  Amount.    The  obligations  in this  Agreement are the  corporate  obligation  of the  Company  only and no recourse shall be had against any  past, present  or  future  member  or  owner  of  the  Company  directly.  The obligations  in  this  Agreement will be handled pari passu with all other outstanding Revenue Share Agreement obligations of the Company that arise as a result of the Offering.

              |  The Company agrees to timely file all tax returns  (federal,  state  and  local)  required  to  be  filed  by  it.   For  so  long  as  the  Total  Repayment Amount  remains  outstanding,  the  Company  will  make  available  to  Investor,  via  the  Company’s website or otherwise, a copy of the Company’s federal tax returns within thirty days of filing such return.  The Company warrants that all such tax returns made available will be true and correct in all  material  respects.The  Company  may,  at  its  sole  discretion,  substitute  audited  financial statements  or  unaudited  financial  statements  signed  by  an  independent  accountant for  the  tax returns  required in this Agreement, in  each  case  prepared in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles applied  on  a  consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and in  each case certified by an officer of the Company.

                li.pb10 The Company files any petition or action for relief under any bankruptcy, reorganization,  insolvency  or  moratorium  law  or  any  other  law  for  the  relief  of,  or  relating  to, debtors, now or hereafter in effect, or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes any action in furtherance of any of the foregoing; or

              b  Characterization  of  Investment.
              |   Investor  acknowledges  and  accepts  that  this Agreement  and  the  promise  to  pay  a  sum  certain  contained  herein  may  be  deemed  a  form  of security  for purposes  of  the  Act.    The parties agree that they shall treat this  obligation to  repay the Total Repayment Amount as debt for financial, tax and other applicable purposes, and not as equity.  The promise to pay amounts due pursuant to this Agreement is an unsecured obligation and may, under certain circumstance, be deemed to be a promissory note or a form of unsecured loan.  Investor acknowledges that the contractual rights contained in this Agreement include the Company’s  promise  to  repay  the  Total  Repayment  Amount  over  time  in  variable  amounts  and consequently,  an  interest  rate  may  be  impossible  to  calculate.   To  the  extent  allowed  under applicable  law,  the  Revenue  Share  Payment  and  any  portion  thereof  will  not  be  considered interest  under  state  usury  laws.The  parties  agree  that  the  Investment  Amount  does  not  accrue interest because the promise to pay the Total Repayment Amount is effective immediately upon execution of this Agreement.  Investor understands and accepts that there is no specific date upon which  Total  Repayment  Amount  will  be  repaid  that  can  be  calculated  as  of  the  date  of  this Agreement.  Investor hereby authorizes the Company to make any withholding required by law.

The  Company  may require   that   any   desired   transferee   deliver   to   the   Company   a   signed   written   agreement acknowledging  and  agreeing  to  these  restrictions  on  transfer.The  Company  may  assign  this instrument  in  whole,  without  the  consent  of  the  Investor,  in  connection  with  any  Change  of Control  or  reincorporation  to  change  the  Company’s  domicile.

              b Amendments.
              |  Any  provision  of  this  instrument  may  be  amended,  waived  or modified upon the written consent of the Company and the participants in the Offering holding a majority of the dollar amount raised in the Offering.

              b Notice.
