                  p.pb10 Crowdfunding is a powerful tool that can help your business raise more than money. You have the ability to turn your customers into owners, who can then become brand ambassadors and evangelists, spreading the word about your product or service. The crowd can help you gauge demand for your product and provide input to help you refine your offering. The crowd can also provide the knowledge and experience you might seek to bring you to the next level.

                  p.pb10 James Surowiecki wrote a book called The Wisdom of Crowds, where he demonstrates that often the collective wisdom of crowds is more accurate than that of an expert; by obtaining a large number of independent opinions, you can de-correlate error and arrive at a more accurate assessment.

                  p.pb10 There are no assurances that any campaign will be successful or will secure enough investor commitments to reach a minimum target. Each crowdfunding investment will involve risk to the investor who must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the terms of the offering. We have provided educational and reference material in the resources center tab which can help you better understand the risks.

They can help spread the word about your offering and their investment can help you gain early traction toward achieving your fundraising goal. 

                  p.pb10 You likely already have a lot of the content you’ll need including your business plan, elevator pitch, capital structure and financial statements.

The better you can highlight the unique attributes of your product to the investment community, the higher your chances of success. Specifically, you’ll need:

                  p.pb10 In order for companies to raise capital under Regulation Crowdfunding, they are required to file certain disclosures in a specified format referred to as Form C. The Form C must be available to potential investors during your fundraise and will be filed with the SEC. GrowthFountain assists companies in populating and filing their Form C. GrowthFountain, however, is not a legal advisor and does not purport to provide legal advice. We recommend in all cases that people discuss the offerings and investments with their own legal counsel.

                  p.pb10 No. All offering terms will be determined in advance and all investors will receive the same terms. There is no negotiation involved in a crowdfunding transaction since you get to set the terms and each investor gets to determine whether they want to participate on those terms.

                      | If you choose to offer a Revenue Share Agreement, you would make annual payments to your investors from a repayment pool equal to 5% of your revenue until two times (2x) the amount invested is paid back. No distributions would be required until your second full fiscal year and you would also be allowed one year of forbearance as needed.  These obligations would be unsecured and contain no pre-payment penalty. This security may be a good choice for:

                    li It may be easier to raise capital and attract investors by offering the potential to earn regular cash distributions

                    li It gives you the chance to keep more of the upside since once investors’ have received 2x their money back, you will have no further obligation

                     | Additionally, when compared to most bank loans or other forms of financing, the Revenue Share approach provides entrepreneurs with less risk exposure since it requires no collateral or personal guarantee.   We designed the Revenue Share Agreement to be a flexible repayment mechanism that does not contain many of the financial covenants that would be found in a typical bank loan.

                  p.pb10 A Revenue Share Agreement is designed to pay investors back through annual payments based on a business's revenue.  Instead of requiring a business to pay a fixed amount each month over a certain period of time (as typically required under a bank loan or term note), a Revenue Share Agreement requires a business to set aside a fixed percentage of its annual gross revenues and to repay investors from that revenue pool annually until each investor has been repaid a multiple of their investment. For the Revenue Share Agreement currently offered through GrowthFountain, the total repayment amount for each investor would be calculated by multiplying the amount invested in the Revenue Share Agreement by two (i.e., each investor is paid back twice (2x) the amount invested).  The Revenue Share Agreement provides each investor with the opportunity to receive annual cash payments and provides the company with flexibility on repayment.  On GrowthFountain, the Revenue Share Agreement offers each company with additional flexibility beyond tying payments to revenue since the company would not have to start making payments until the end of its second full fiscal year and if one year the company has difficulty making payments, there is a one-time forbearance right.

                  p.pb10 A Revenue Share Agreement is not an ownership interest like equity, and is more like a debt security.  A Revenue Share Agreement provides entrepreneurs with capital in exchange for a series of annual payments from a pool generated from a percentage of future revenues, so investors are technically investing in a promise by the company to repay amounts over time.  In terms of equity, there is no promise to repay any amounts.  With a Revenue Share Agreement, investors are promised annual distributions but have those amounts capped over time so that the “upside” is limited.  In terms of equity, there is potentially unlimited “upside” but no ability to receive cash payments on an ongoing basis without the company voluntarily deciding to make distributions.  Investors may see a benefit from a Revenue Share Agreement because a shorter repayment period increases the investors' rate of return. Additionally, the flexible payment structure helps align the economic interests of the business and its investors because with equity, investors may want to pressure the business to provide an early exit or liquidation event that could misalign interests.

                  p.pb10 The terms of each Revenue Share Agreement are clearly described in the subscription agreement that would be available for review in connection with any offering.  While you would want to reference the subscription agreement for a full understanding of the terms, the most material standard terms would include the following:
                  ol.simple-list
                    li 
                      | Revenue Pool Percentage: each investor is paid from a revenue pool that is created by setting aside a percent of the annual gross revenue of the company.  On GrowthFountain, the standard percentage set-aside is 5% of annual gross revenue.

                    li 
                      | Repayment Multiple: each investor is repaid an annual portion of the revenue pool described above until they are repaid a total amount which is a multiple of the amount that they originally invested.  On GrowthFountain, investors are repaid a total amount equal to twice (2x) their investment amount (excluding any fees related to the investment).
                    li
                      | Repayment Start: this refers to the time that the company starts making the annual payments.  On GrowthFountain, the repayment start is not until the end of the company’s second full fiscal year, so no payment is required after the company’s first fiscal year or any partial year prior to that.
                    li
                      | Forbearance Allowance: this is a right given to the company that allows it to avoid making an annual payment.  It offers the company flexibility so that if it really needs the extra revenue, it is not required to make the annual investor payment.  On GrowthFountain, each company is limited to a one time use of a forbearance right, so they are only able to miss one annual payment before going into default.

                  p.pb10 Unlike a traditional loan, a Revenue Share Agreement does not carry a fixed interest rate, does not have a consistently predictable repayment schedule and does not have a set maturity date. A business that has taken out a bank loan is required to make payments in fixed amounts regardless of how it is performing. In contrast, a Revenue Share Agreement provides some flexibility and allows the company to make annual payments that rise and fall in correlation with its annual gross revenues. Because a Revenue Share Agreement provides payment flexibility to a business based on its performance, payments made to investors will vary unlike a traditional loan. If the business performs better than expected, the investors could be paid back in a shorter period of time, but in general, a Revenue Share Agreement does not have the predictability of fixed payments that are available in a traditional loan.

For companies that are looking to raise money with us, we charge a registration fee of $500 to help mitigate some of the fixed costs that we incur related to performing background checks, reviewing campaigns and filing documents. If a company is able to successfully meet their minimum fundraising goal, we charge a success fee representing 6% of the total amount raised in the offering along with the pass through of any variable costs attributable to the offerings. We believe that the minimal upfront fees properly align our interests with yours so that we both derive the most benefit when your offering is successful.
                  p.pb10 For investors that participate in an offering, we charge a minimal participation fee of $10 to defray costs. This fee may be waived in certain circumstances and as would be expected, all fees are subject to change and are always fully disclosed in the documentation related to each purchase of securities.
