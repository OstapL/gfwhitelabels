                        p.pb10.text-justify Company listings on this Platform are only suitable for Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with illiquid investments, particularly in light of added business risk that early stage and emerging companies pose. Securities sold through this Platform are not publicly traded and, therefore, are less liquid. An Investor’s ability to resell the securities is restricted for a period of one year from the date of purchase. During that time, the purchased securities may only be transferred (a) back to the issuer, (b) to an accredited investor, (c) as part of an offering registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission, or (d) to a member of the Investor’s family or the equivalent or in connection with a death or divorce. Securities purchased in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering are likely to be very illiquid, and you may not be able to sell your investment even after the one year restriction period has passed. Investing in companies listed on this Platform requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
                        p.pb10.text-justify Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Platform do not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose their entire value, and there is no bank guarantee.
                        p.pb10.text-justify Any arraignment or listings of offerings on the Platform should NOT be considered investing advice or promotion for an offering, but have been efficiently compiled for the users based on objective criteria discussed in Regulation Crowdfunding. Further, the User understands and acknowledges that GFC has sole discretion for the gating and listing of Offerings on the Platform. GFC retains the right to gate and list any offering to comply with Regulation Crowdfunding, increase investor protection, decrease potential chances of fraud, and to promote diversity among issuers offering securities through the Platform.
                        p.text-justify None of the information contained on the Platform constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities, options or other financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or service. The information and services provided on the Platform are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where GrowthFountain is not authorized to provide such information or services. Some products and services described in the Platform may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all people.

                        p.pb10.text-justify GrowthFountain and its employees are prohibited from offering financial advice for the issuing and sale of securities on its platform.  All users are strongly encouraged to seek advice from an independent accounting professional before preparing their valuations and before the purchase of any securities offered under Regulation CF. All issuer valuations, including but not limited to; business worth, price per share, % of ownership (collectively “Specifics”) are prepared without review and evaluation of our company or an independent accountant.  None of the information contained on the platform constitutes a recommendation, legal or investment advice and are by law made accessible for each users’ independent review.
                        p.pb10.text-justify We are not liable for any improper business valuations nor any belief that these are created or prepared by our company.  You are solely responsible for the purchase or sale of securities.  Further, any disagreement including but not limited to; % of company owned, % of ownership per share, price per share, business valuation can not be attributed to GrowthFountain or its subsidiaries and are governed by the terms laid out in the Governing Law/Arbitration section.

                        h3.text-uppercase.dosis.text-xs-center Proprietary Rights
                        p.pb10.text-justify The GrowthFountain logo is a trademark and service mark of GrowthFountain. GrowthFountain or its licensors own and retain all proprietary rights in the Platform, and all material and information posted thereon. You acknowledge and agree that all the intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trade marks, and trade secrets, in the Platform and its content are owned by GrowthFountain or its licensors.

You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your content if you desire.
                        p.pb10.text-justify You hereby grant (and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) to GrowthFountain an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit the data, information, images, digital content or other communications that you upload, input or otherwise provide to the Platform.
                        p.pb10.text-justify If you directly or indirectly provide GrowthFountain with any feedback, suggestions, ideas or improvements regarding the Platform (“Feedback”), you hereby assign to GrowthFountain all rights in such Feedback and agree that GrowthFountain shall have the right to use and fully exploit such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate.  You agree that you will not submit to GrowthFountain any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary or that belong to a third-party to whom you owe an obligation of confidentiality.
                        p.text-justify In addition, to the extent you receive information from GrowthFountain, Issuers or other Investors with respect to any investment activity on the Platform, you may not further disclose or otherwise provide such information to another party in any way that allows a personal identification of such Issuer or Investor. You agree that GrowthFountain may, at its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by law, access, read, preserve and disclose your account information, usage history and submitted content in order to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties, including intellectual property rights; (c) enforce this Agreement and investigate potential violations thereof; (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (e) respond to your requests for customer service; or (f) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GrowthFountain, its users, or the public.

                        h3.text-uppercase.dosis.text-xs-center Listing Limitations
                        p.text-justify Not all applications that are received by GrowthFountain will qualify to be listed on the Platform. GrowthFountain makes no promises or assurances whatsoever that any company that submits an application for consideration or that completes any portion of the campaign or Form C submissions will be listed on the Platform.  GrowthFountain is committed to investor protection and may from time to time adopt internal policies designed to detect or reduce the risk of potential fraud.  Based on these and other internal policies, GrowthFountain may determine it its sole and absolute discretion to reject a company for listing, to request additional information regarding a company seeking to be listed or to place a company submission on hold for any amount of time that GrowthFountain deems appropriate.  GrowthFountain reserves the right to prioritize certain company submissions over others and to allow certain companies to list before others regardless of the order that submissions were received.  By accessing the Platform, you agree and accept that any selection criteria or fraud prevention policies employed by GrowthFountain do not constitute investment advice, do not provide any warranty that fraud will be identified or detected and do not obligate GrowthFountain to take any action that is not required by law.  GrowthFountain does not perform any form of comprehensive diligence on the companies that list on the Platform and you may not rely on the fact that a company has listed on the Platform in order to conclude that it has been vetted, approved or endorsed in any manner.  GrowthFountain relies on the information submitted by companies seeking to be listed on the Platform and does not have the ability to verify all of the information submitted, so in using the Platform, you agree to release GrowthFountain from any claim that it had any form of duty to verify, investigate or otherwise confirm any information submitted by a company seeking to be listed on the Platform.

                        p.pb10.text-justify The period of time during which each Promotion will run (“Promotion Period”) will be stated in connection with each Promotion.  For any “limited time” offer, GrowthFountain may, in its sole discretion, end the Promotion at any time.

Each Promotion will automatically close at the end of the relevant Promotion Period, at which point GrowthFountain may prevent further participation in the Promotion.
                        p.pb10.text-justify For any Promotion limited to “new customers” or “new accounts”, then such Promotion may only be redeemed once per individual and each individual must not maintain or initiate more than one account on the Platform.

                        p.pb10.text-justify Each Promotion is intended for the addressed recipient only and cannot be transferred. If you are not the intended recipient or within the intended category of recipient, then the offer is null and void.

We reserve the right to request further information from you if you wish to participate in certain Promotions.

You will not have the ability to withdraw or receive in cash any Credit and you will forfeit the Credit if you do not use the Credit to make an investment within 90 days of receiving the Credit.  GrowthFountain may from time to time reflect a Credit amount earned from one or more Promotions in your account listed on the Platform.  GrowthFountain reserves the right to withdraw any Credit amount in your account upon the expiration of the Credit.  You are solely responsible for the payment of any applicable tax in relation to a Credit or any value received in connection with a Promotion (including without limitation the cost of complying with any requirements of applicable local law).
                        p.pb10.text-justify For any Credit offered for “inviting a friend”, the amount of such Credit will post to your account after the friend you referred participates in their first closed transaction on the Platform.  You will not be awarded any Credit for any cancelled or withdrawn investment from a referred friend or for your referred friend’s participation in any unsuccessful offering.  Any individual affiliated with a company that is issuing or proposing to issue securities on the Platform is ineligible to earn any credit for referring people to the Platform.
                        p.text-justify GrowthFountain reserves the right to alter, discontinue or terminate any Promotion, or any aspect of it, at any time, with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if there has been any printing, production, distribution or other error in any Promotion communication or on the Platform.  If any Promotion cannot be executed as planned, including due to any technical problems or circumstances beyond GrowthFountain’s control, GrowthFountain shall incur no liability. GrowthFountain’s determination and decision on all matters will be final and binding.
