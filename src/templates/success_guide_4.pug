                    p Though a video isn’t mandatory, statistics demonstrate that fundraising campaigns that contain a video are far more likely to succeed. The video does not have to be professionally produced – you can even shoot it on a smart phone. A couple things to keep in mind:

                    li
                        | Make sure to introduce your team and show some personality – investors invest based on capability and likeability first – then product/service second!

                        | Be sure to demo/fully explain your product or service with passion and excitement
