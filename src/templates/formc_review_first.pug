        p.pb10 If a potential investor is interested in participating in the Offering, such investor must first open an account with the Intermediary by registering at www.GrowthFountain.com.  During such registration process, the Intermediary may request financial information to determine investor’s eligibility and may require the acceptance of certain terms and conditions applicable to investor’s use of the Platform. In addition, prior to communicating any investment commitment, each investor must (a) consent to electronic delivery of materials, (b) provide a representation that such investor has reviewed the educational material available from the Intermediary delivered pursuant to Rule 302 of Regulation Crowdfunding, (c) provide a representation that such investor understands that the entire investment amount may be lost and that such investor could bear such loss, (d) complete a questionnaire demonstrating such investor’s understanding that there are limitations on cancelling an investment commitment and that it may be difficult to resell securities acquired in this Offering.

The process generally involves the following steps: (1) an investor registered on the Platform identifies a desired offering and communicates an investment commitment to purchase securities in such offering by completing a subscription agreement; (2) the Intermediary confirms the investor’s eligibility to participate in the Offering and then has the subscription agreement countersigned by the issuer; (3) the investor transfers the funds required to purchase the offered securities to the Intermediary’s designated escrow agent; (4) once the targeted minimum offering amount is achieved or exceeded through investor

        p.pb10 Investors may cancel an investment commitment at any time up until forty-eight (48) hours prior to the applicable closing date.  The process for any such cancellation is for the investor to log onto the Platform and indicate a cancellation by selecting such option in connection with the applicable offering once they have logged into their account and accessed their investor dashboard.  With respect to specific scenarios: (1) if the target minimum offering amount is not met prior to the target closing date, then the Intermediary will automatically cancel all investment commitments and notify each investor of the return of their respective funds, (2) if the issuer reaches the target minimum offering amount prior to the deadline identified in the offering materials, then it may close the offering early (if it provides notice about the new offering deadline at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline) provided that the investor would be able to cancel the investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to the new offering deadline, (3) if the issuer notifies the investor of a material change to an offering, then the investor must reconfirm their investment commitment after the material change is made to the offering, or such investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled and the committed funds will be returned.

Such calculators use the data provided by the Company and do not reflect any advice or recommendation on the part of the Intermediary.  In working with the calculators, the Company considered its current capital structure, including current debt and cash, and assembled an income statement from the last twelve months including an estimate of net income and EBITDA.  The Company also made projections for the next twelve months along with a similar estimate of net income and EBITDA.
        p.pb10 The Company then looked at potential peers that trade in public markets and considered a variety of metrics, including but not limited to Price/Sales, Enterprise Value/EBITDA and Price/Equity.  The Company applied a 20% liquidity discount to publically traded peers and utilized an average of different valuation metrics to derive a benchmarking range for the Company’s ultimate value.

        p.pb10 The price of each Share was determined by the Company in good faith based on its own assessment of its current position and by taking a variety of quantitative and qualitative considerations into account.  Quantitatively, the Company considered revenue and operating profit, both one year from now and five years from now along with an analysis of the Company’s existing capital structure and available cash.  The Company then assessed where publicly traded peer were being valued in the markets.  After considering several different valuation metrics, including Price/Sales and Enterprise Value/EBIT, the Company discounted its valuation by its cost of capital.  The, for qualitative factors, the Company considered the type of industry that it is in and applied a discount rate appropriate for such industry.  Finally, the Company applied a liquidity discount which resulted in a post-money valuation which takes into consideration the money projected to be raised in order to derive the valuation contained in this Material.

          u Risks as a Minority Holder
        p.pb10.text-indent Purchasers of a minority ownership have risks relating to limited control, limited information and limited rights.  Minority owners have no control over the marketability and value of their purchased securities and they may be required to hold onto their minority ownership position for an indefinite period.  Additionally, minority owners must address the following risks:
        ul
          li.pb10 Minority owners have no right to participate in any management decisions of the Company or the day-to-day operations. There is the risk that the majority owners make decisions or take actions that a minority owner thinks is bad for the Company.   A minority owner has limited ability to influence the governance and operations of a Company.
          li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights to information beyond those filings that are required by law to be made available.  There is the risk that minority owners may be denied immediate information about the Company’s performance or corporate affairs.
          li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights, if any, to demand current distributions from an operating business. Majority owners likely have the right and power to avoid making any distributions of profits at their discretion.  There is also the risk that the management of the Company pursues a spending plan that causes the Company not to generate any profits to be distributed.

          li.pb10 Minority owners have limited rights, if any, to have their interest bought out. There is the risk that a minority owner will want to sell their interest and they will have no right to force the Company to buy them out.  There will also be liquidity risk if there is no secondary market for the Company’s securities.
          li.pb10 Minority owners have limited input into fundamental corporate changes such as sale of the Company.  There is a risk that a sale could be structured in a way to avoid certain payouts to minority owners, such as a sale of assets over time with the proceeds reinvested in another business.
          li.pb10 Minority owners may have interests that are different than shareholder-officers or shareholders that are part of the management team of the Company.  There is the risk that minority owners perceive a conflict of interest if, for example, the managers that are shareholders receive a significant raise.  Additionally, there is the risk that a minority owner will want to remove a manager or board member but have no independent power to do so.

          u Risks Regarding Corporate Actions
        p.pb10 The Company may take certain corporate actions that could impact investors that purchase the Shares.
        ul
          li.pb10 Regarding the additional issuances of securities, there is the risk that an investor has their ownership percentage diluted if, for example, the Company decides to raise additional amounts in the future.  There is also the risk that an investor is excluded from the opportunity to participate in future fund-raising so that they are unable to maintain their ownership percentage.
          li.pb10 Regarding the authorization of new securities with different rights, there is the risk that a future investor is able to obtain rights that are superior to the rights afforded to the purchasers of the security available in this offering.
          li.pb10 To the extent that there is ever an offer to repurchase the Shares by the Company, there is the risk that investors may feel pressured to sell their Shares to the Company without fully participating in or capturing the potential increase in value of such Shares.
          li.pb10 Regarding a sale of the Company or of assets of the Company, there is the risk that any such transaction fails to maximize the value of the Company’s securities.  The investor will be required to rely on the business judgement of the management team and the Board of Directors of the Company so there can be no guarantee that the investor will receive the full market value of their Shares
          li.pb10 Regarding transactions with related parties, there is the risk that the Company is placed in a position that creates the possibility of a conflict of interest.  The Company may choose to participate in transactions with affiliates and related persons, with limited disclosure required to investors.

          u Risks from an Investment in Securities
        p.pb10.text-indent This Offering is being made on a conditional basis with no minimum number of Shares guaranteed to be sold.

        p.pb10.text-indent The Shares are not guaranteed or insured by any government agency or by any private party. The amount of earnings is not guaranteed and can vary with market conditions. The return of all or any portion of capital invested in the Shares is not guaranteed, and the Shares could become worthless.
        p.pb10.text-indent Investors should be aware of the potentially long-term nature of their investment. Each purchaser of Shares will be required to represent that it is purchasing such securities for its own account for investment purposes and not with an intention to resell or distribute. Purchasers may be required to bear the economic risks of the investment for an indefinite period of time. There is currently no public market for the Company’s securities.  Ultimately, each investor’s risk with respect to this Offering includes the potential for a complete loss of their investment.

          u Risks from Uncertain Capital Needs
        p.pb10.text-indent The Company believes that the net proceeds of the Offering will be sufficient to fund the implementation of the Company’s business plan, operations and growth for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, in the event that additional capital is required, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available at all or on terms favorable to the Company. If adequate funds were not available to satisfy either short or long-term capital requirements, the Company may be unable to continue in business, with a resulting loss of all or part of investments made by the Company’s investors. Moreover, if additional equity securities are issued in connection with future financings, the ownership percentages of then shareholders could be diluted. Dilution of ownership percentages may also occur as a result of equity securities issued pursuant to possible sales or grants to existing shareholders, officers, managers, consultants, advisors, and/or employees.

          u Risks from Relying on an Exemption from Registration
        p.pb10.text-indent The Shares are being offered for sale in reliance upon certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. If the sale of the Shares were to fail to qualify for these exemptions, purchasers may seek rescission of their purchases of the Shares. If a number of purchasers were to obtain rescission, the Company would face significant financial demands, which could adversely affect the Company as a whole, as well as any non-rescinding purchasers.
