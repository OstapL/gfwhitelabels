          p.m-b-1 you get to set a minimum and maximum fund raising goal, up to $1 million each year. However, if you don’t reach your minimum goal, all funds will be returned to investors.
          p.m-b-1 The level of financials required is dependent on where you set your maximum goal. For first time issuers: A) if $100,000 or less: Financials must be signed by ceo; B) if $100,001-$1,000,000: financials must be signed by an independent accountant – for the previous two years or since inception, whichever is shorter – even if you had no revenue.
