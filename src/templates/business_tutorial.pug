          p.m-b-1 you get to set a minimum and maximum fund raising goal, up to $1 million each year. However, if you don’t reach your minimum goal, all funds will be returned to investors.
          p.m-b-1 The level of financials required is dependent on where you set your maximum goal. For first time issuers: A) if $100,000 or less: Financials must be signed by ceo; B) if $100,001-$1,000,000: financials must be signed by an independent accountant – for the previous two years or since inception, whichever is shorter – even if you had no revenue.
          p.m-b-1 While we can’t offer any investment advice, we have provided tools to help you assess the amount of money to raise based on your growth ambition (see resource center).
          p.m-b-1 We also provide calculators designed to help you assess your valuation as you determine the terms of your raise (see resource center).

          p.m-b-1 Roughly one-half of small businesses fail within five years. for those that succeed, the time horizon to create value for shareholders tends to be 7+ years.  Being an entrepreneur is not for the feint-of-heart.
          p.m-b-1 It's possible THAT you MIGHT not raise the MINIMUM GOAL YOU SET FOR YOUR OFFERING, AND IF NOT THE FUNDS COMMITTED BY INVESTORS WILL BE RETURNED TO THEM.
          p There are also risks to your investors, and you'll be expected to disclose them in their entirety prior to your fundraising campaign going live. We've designed the application process to ensure your disclosures are AS easy to make as possible, saving you valuable time.

          p.m-b-1 1. CREATE A VERY COMPELLING CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING A VIDEO, MEDIA AND DESCRIPTION THAT EXCITES POTENTIAL INVESTORS.
          p 2. TAP INTO YOUR NETWORK OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS. DATA SUGGESTS THAT COMPANIES THAT CAN RAISE ONE-THIRD OF THEIR GOAL FROM THEIR OWN NETWORK HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY OF GOING VIRAL AND SUCCEEDING. CREATE A LIST OF PEOPLE TO WHOM YOU WILL BROADCAST YOUR CAMPAIGN. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK, FRIENDS, FAMILY, CUSTOMERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS, SUPPLIERS, ETC.
