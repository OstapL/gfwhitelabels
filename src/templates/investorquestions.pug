                                        |  in Rule 501 of Regulation D). In general, accredited investor means that you a) have $1 million in net worth not including your primary residence or b) earned $200k in each of the last two years and expect to earn the same this year (or $300k if including your spouse). About 2% of the American population meets this threshold. Regulation Crowdfunding allows non-accredited investors to purchase certain amounts of private securities. In President Obama’s words, “For the first time, ordinary Americans will be able to go online and invest in entrepreneurs that they believe in.”

The terms of the securities will govern your rights so please carefully review the relevant Form C to get such information. Make sure you understand the investment and the risks involved.

Once you find an investment that interests you, simply click the “INVEST” button to communicate your investment commitment and complete a Subscription Agreement. We take you through the investment process step by step and will ask you the questions needed to ensure your eligibility to participate in the offering. Once you make an investment commitment, your funds will be processed and securely held with a third-party FDIC insured escrow agent. When the company reaches their minimum investment target, the funds will be transferred and you will become a security holder in the company. If the company does not reach its fundraising goal, your committed funds will be returned to you. GrowthFountain does not take possession of any investor funds during the process.

It is difficult to know how companies will grow, what changes might occur in the market or the many ways a company can stumble. In general, crowdfunding investors have the risks associated with being a minority shareholder in so far as they have limited control and information rights. You should review the Form C to read more about the specific risk factors involved in an offering. Investing in early stage businesses requires high risk-tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.

                                    p.pb10 Securities issued in reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding are subject to a 12 month holding period with only limited exceptions on transfer. In limited circumstances, you may be able to transfer your purchased securities back to the issuer, to an accredited investor or to family members. But in general, it is more likely that you will be unable to freely resell your securities for at least a year and perhaps longer. Please note that it may be difficult or impossible to find liquidity for your shares because they are not listed on any exchange and a public trading market may never develop. You should not invest in any offering if you have an immediate need for the return of your funds.

                                    p.pb10 Please be sure to understand the risks involved in Regulation Crowdfunding since it is possible that you see no return or lose the value of your entire investment. Your ability to earn a return will be linked to the success of the issuer and the terms of the security that you purchased. PayBack Equity provides the possibility of earning a return through receipt of distributions. For Equity, you may earn a return if and when 1) the company pays a dividend; 2) the company is bought; or 3) the company has an initial public offering and lists on a public exchange.

After you make an investment commitment, you will have the opportunity to change your mind and cancel your subscription up until 48 hours prior to the date of the funding closing. If you have not cancelled your investment commitment prior to the final 48 hours of an offering, then your commitment will become irrevocable.
