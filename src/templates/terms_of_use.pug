                        h3#securities_products.text-uppercase.dosis.m-t-0.m-b-1.text-xs-center Securities Products
                        p.pb10 Company listings on this Platform are only suitable for Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with illiquid investments, particularly in light of added business risk that early stage and emerging companies pose. Securities sold through this Platform are not publicly traded and, therefore, are less liquid. An Investor’s ability to resell the securities is restricted for a period of one year from the date of purchase. During that time, the purchased securities may only be transferred (a) back to the issuer, (b) to an accredited investor, (c) as part of an offering registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission, or (d) to a member of the Investor’s family or the equivalent or in connection with a death or divorce. Securities purchased in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering are likely to be very illiquid, and you may not be able to sell your investment even after the one year restriction period has passed. Investing in companies listed on this Platform requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
                        p.pb10 Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Platform do not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose their entire value, and there is no bank guarantee.
                        p.pb10 None of the information contained on the Platform constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities, options or other financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or service. The information and services provided on the Platform are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where GrowthFountain is not authorized to provide such information or services. Some products and services described in the Platform may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all people.
