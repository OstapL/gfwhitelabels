The parties agree that this Agreement contains no specific due date for the repayment of the Total Repayment Amount.   The Total Repayment Amount will be considered paid in full when  the  Company  has  paid  to  the  Investor  those  Revenue  Share  Payments  which,  when aggregated  with  any  prepayment  amounts,  collectively  are  equal  to  the  Total  Repayment Amount.

Investor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  all  payments  required  by  this  Agreement,  including optional  payments  with  respect  to  any  prepayment  amounts,  shall  be  made  pro  rata  among  the Investor  and  all  of  the  Holders  based  on  the  amount  of  their  investment  in  the  Offering (excluding any fees paid to participate in the Offering) and the Investor shall make no claim for any  amount  of  any  Company  payment  greater  that  the  Investor’s  Proportionate  Share  of  such payment.    If  the  Investor  shall  obtain  any  payment  from  the  Company  that  was  not  made proportionately  to  other  Holders,  then  the  Investor  shall  return  the  excess  amount  to  the Company  to  be  shared  ratably  with  the  other  Holders.  The  Company’s  repayment  obligation  to the Investor under this Agreement shall be on parity with the Company’s obligation to repay all of the Holders of securities issued in the same Offering.  If the Company does not have sufficient funds  to  repay  all  participants  in  the  Offering,  then  payment  shall  be  made ona pro  rata  basis among  the  Investor  and  all  of  the  Holders  based  on  the  amount  of  their  investment  in  the Offering (excluding any fees paid to participate in the Offering).

No  party has  guaranteed  the  repayment  of  the  Total  Repayment  Amount.     The  obligations  in  this Agreement  are  the  corporate  obligation  of  the  Company  only  and  no  recourse  shall  be  had against any past, present or future member or owner of the Company directly. The obligations in this Agreement will be handled pari passu with all other  outstanding  Revenue  Share Agreement obligations of the Company that arise as a result of the Offering.

          u Characterization  of  Investment.
        |   Investor  acknowledges  and  accepts  that  this Agreement  and  the  promise  to  pay  a  sum  certain  contained  herein  may  be  deemed  a  form  of security  for purposes  of the Act.   The parties agree that they shall treat this  obligation to  repay the Total Repayment Amount as debt for financial, tax and other applicable purposes, and not as equity.  The promise to pay amounts due pursuant to this Agreement is an unsecured obligation and may, under certain circumstance, be deemed to be a promissory note or a form of unsecured loan.  Investor acknowledges that the contractual rights contained in this Agreement include the Company’s  promise  to  repay  the  Total  Repayment  Amount  over  time  in  variable  amounts  and consequently,  an  interest  rate  may  be  impossible  to  calculate.   To  the  extent  allowed  under applicable  law,  the  Revenue  Share  Payment  and  any  portion  thereof  will not  be  considered interest under state usury laws.The parties agree that the  Investment Amount does not accrue interest because the promise to pay the Total Repayment Amount is effective immediately upon execution  of  this  Agreement.    Investor  understands  and  accepts  that  there  is no  specific  date upon which Total Repayment Amount will be repaid that can be calculated as of the date of this Agreement.  Investor hereby authorizes the Company to make any withholding required by law.

The  Company may  require  that  any  desired  transferee  deliver  to  the  Company  a  signed  written  agreement acknowledging  and  agreeing  to  these  restrictions  on  transfer.The  Company  may  assign  this instrument  in  whole,  without  the  consent  of  the  Investor,  in  connection  with  any  Change  of Control  or  reincorporation  to  change  the  Company’s  domicile.
